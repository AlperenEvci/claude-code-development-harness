# Changelog

## Unreleased

Phase 1 of the v1.0 harness upgrade. See `.ai/decisions/0001-harness-v1-architecture.md`.

### Added

- Optional `context_policy` object in the project profile: a working token band, a ceiling
  action, work that must be isolated out of the main session, and standing context rules.
- `## Context budget` section in generated `AGENTS.md`, stating the band and what to do on
  reaching the ceiling.
- `## Context discipline` section in generated `CLAUDE.md`, listing what belongs in an isolated
  agent rather than the main session.
- Validator check rejecting a package whose profile lacks a normalized `context_policy`, or whose
  `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` does not state the configured band, so the contract cannot drift
  from the profile.
- Tests covering rendered defaults, custom values, and six invalid-policy rejections.

### Changed

- `context_policy` defaults to a 150000-200000 token band with `checkpoint-and-handoff`.
  Profiles that omit it stay valid, so this release is backward compatible.


## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-27

### Added

- First-class **Greenfield / Create** flow for empty and planning-only project folders.
- Inspector `project_state` classification with `empty`, `minimal-planning`, `harness-only`, and `existing` states.
- Guided Greenfield interview covering problem, users, primary outcome, MVP scope, non-goals, workflows, stack direction, constraints, milestones, and open questions.
- Two Greenfield setup depths:
  - `context-only` for harness + durable project briefs,
  - `ready-to-build` for an additional reviewed first bootstrap contract.
- Greenfield artifacts under `.ai/project/`: product brief, planned architecture, roadmap, and open questions.
- Optional root project README generation.
- Greenfield-aware backlog and first scaffold specification.
- `examples/greenfield-standard.json`.
- Validation and installed-harness checks for Greenfield packages.
- Tests for blank-folder detection, README-only planning folders, Greenfield rendering, optional outputs, and invalid Greenfield configurations.

### Changed

- `/development-harness:setup` now explicitly supports `new`, `existing`, and `upgrade` entry paths.
- Create mode may start at Lite or Standard, but never Fleet.
- Planned Greenfield commands and paths are clearly distinguished from verified repository evidence.
- Git initialization, dependency installation, and application scaffolding remain manual and are never executed during setup.
- Generator and plugin version bumped to `0.2.0`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-27

- Initial Claude Code marketplace plugin.
- Repository inspection and adaptive interview.
- Lite, Standard, and Fleet harness generation.
- Official Codex plugin, direct Codex CLI, and Claude-only transports.
- Conflict-aware installer, structural validator, and installed-harness checker.
- Project-specific scoped rules, workflow skills, and read-only domain researchers.
