# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-27

### Added

- First-class **Greenfield / Create** flow for empty and planning-only project folders.
- Inspector `project_state` classification with `empty`, `minimal-planning`, `harness-only`, and `existing` states.
- Guided Greenfield interview covering problem, users, primary outcome, MVP scope, non-goals, workflows, stack direction, constraints, milestones, and open questions.
- Two Greenfield setup depths:
  - `context-only` for harness + durable project briefs,
  - `ready-to-build` for an additional reviewed first bootstrap contract.
- Greenfield artifacts under `.ai/project/`: product brief, planned architecture, roadmap, and open questions.
- Optional root project README generation.
- Greenfield-aware backlog and first scaffold specification.
- `examples/greenfield-standard.json`.
- Validation and installed-harness checks for Greenfield packages.
- Tests for blank-folder detection, README-only planning folders, Greenfield rendering, optional outputs, and invalid Greenfield configurations.

### Changed

- `/development-harness:setup` now explicitly supports `new`, `existing`, and `upgrade` entry paths.
- Create mode may start at Lite or Standard, but never Fleet.
- Planned Greenfield commands and paths are clearly distinguished from verified repository evidence.
- Git initialization, dependency installation, and application scaffolding remain manual and are never executed during setup.
- Generator and plugin version bumped to `0.2.0`.
